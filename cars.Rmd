## Plot speed (x-axis) against distance (y-axis)
```{r}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist,
     main = "Speed vs Stopping Distance",
     xlab = "Speed (mph)",
     ylab = "Stopping Distance (ft)",
     col = "blue",
     pch = 19)
```

# Interpretation

From the plot, a general trend can be observed: as the speed of the car increases, the stopping distance is also increased. A positive correlation between speed and stopping distance is suggested. The relationship appears to be non-linear, with stopping distances being increased more rapidly at higher speeds.
